## About Me
My name is Renlang Huang (Student Member, IEEE). I received the Bachelor's degree of Engineering from Zhejiang University (College of Control Science and Engineering), Hangzhou, China, in 2022. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Liang Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/LiangLi) and [Prof. Jiming Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jmchen) from Group of Networked Sensing and Control (NeSC).

## Research Interest
My research interests focus on localization and mapping, visual and multi-modal perception, deep learning for autonomous mobile robots and autonomous driving.
I plan to incorporate foundation models and generative tasks in my future research about autonomous driving and mobile manipulation.
